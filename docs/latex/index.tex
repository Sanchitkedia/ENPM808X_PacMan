The aim of this project is to design and simulate a swarm robotics algorithm for Acme Robotics The simulation is created in ROS2 Gazebo. The Turtlebot3 burger model is used to simulate our agents. Our algorithm sets a target location, and then directs 25 agents to surround the target based on the selected formation. The swarm can also transition between the different formations. \hypertarget{index_Method}{}\doxysubsection{Method}\label{index_Method}
The simulation is started and the agents are spawned into the gazebo world by runnng a python launch file. We set up a class to initialize nodes for each swarm agent to publish to its command velocity and subscribe to the position provided through Odometry. Next, the master class will ask the user to input desired formation, and then the trajectory will be computed by the methods in the trajectory class. The trajectory class computes goal positions for each agent based on the set target location. The goal location and live position of each agent is then used to direct it towards its goal location. A two sprint Agile Iterative Process approach and test driven development style is utilized in the making of this project. ~\newline
